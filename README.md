# Rock-paper-scissors

This is my first project with Javascript, and being so the case, it aims to be a simple program. 

* The game will be played for five rounds on the javascript console, it and receives input from the user and console, being case-insensitive, and prompting them with three possible options. 

* The program does not contemplate input different from the possible options of the game.
